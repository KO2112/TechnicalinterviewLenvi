I could not do negative testing for the given scenario, I had one on my mind which was: User should not be able to add products to cart if not signed up
However as the website is only for automation practice it accepts the item even if you are not logged in so it was not possible


I tried to use random data as much as I can, so we can pretty much test every single dropdown and different names to make sure everything on there works perfectly fine (I'm imagining this as a real project, I know this website that won't break but trying my best to show you my automation skills)
There are still some hard coded methods on the stepdefinitions but normally I would automate pretty much everything

Thank you so much for giving me an opportunity!
